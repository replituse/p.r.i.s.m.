You are updating my existing React + MySQL Desktop Booking Software (Electron or Tauri).
Follow all requirements exactly.
Keep UI clean, modern, beautifully aligned, and smooth transitions everywhere.

🔧 1. Make the Settings Button Fully Functional

Create a Settings page with full functionality.

Options should include:

App preferences

Theme (light/dark toggle)

Database connection test

Role management (Admin/User)

Notification settings

Ensure the settings button opens smoothly and updates persist using MySQL.

🗓 2. Fix Dashboard Alignment Issues

(Refer to screenshot 1)

Fix the cut calendar/date component—it must fit correctly inside the card.

Proper alignment for:

Calendar

Bookings table

Search bar

Add Booking button

Make layout responsive for desktop resolutions.

📋 3. Dashboard Enhancements

Add the following items to the Dashboard booking table:

a) “View All Records” Button

On dashboard card top-right

Opens all booking records (paginated)

b) Apply Proper Status Colors

Cancel = Red

Planning = Blue

Tentative = Yellow

Confirmed = Green

c) Delete Booking Feature

After a booking is cancelled, show a Delete button

Clicking Delete removes the record from dashboard but saves history in MySQL:

When created

When cancelled

When deleted

Who performed the action

History must appear in Booking Reports.

🧾 4. Invoice / Billing System

(Refer to screenshot 3 – PDF sample)

When a booking is Completed, generate an invoice automatically.

Invoice fields required:

Booking date

Project name

Customer

Room

Editor

From time – To time

Break time

Actual time

Total hours

Hourly cost

Total cost

Generate in PDF format with clean alignment like sample

Add buttons:

View Invoice

Download Invoice

Store all invoices in MySQL for future viewing.

📤 5. Fix Export PDF / Excel

Export must work according to the current filters:

Report Type

Date Range

Room

Booking Status

PDF and Excel must accurately reflect filtered data only.

📊 6. Booking Report Section Enhancements
Add “View All” Button

Top-right corner

Shows all booking history for month/year:

Cancelled

Planning

Tentative

Confirmed

Completed

Rearrange Layout

Move the following UP:

Total Bookings

Total Hours

Confirmed

Cancelled

Move these DOWN:

Report Type

From Date

To Date

Room

Status

🎨 7. UI/UX Improvements

Add modern spacing + padding

Rounded cards

Smooth transitions

Animations for opening modals and reports

Improve readability and align tables

Match the look of screenshots provided

Remove UI clipping or overflow issues

🏷 8. Add Center Heading

At the top header bar, center text:

PRISM Software

Keep it bold, clean, and nicely aligned with the calendar icon and user profile.

📦 9. Final Packaging

Ensure the app builds properly as a desktop app (Electron or Tauri):

npm run build

.exe output

Must connect to MySQL (not SQLite or local DB).
