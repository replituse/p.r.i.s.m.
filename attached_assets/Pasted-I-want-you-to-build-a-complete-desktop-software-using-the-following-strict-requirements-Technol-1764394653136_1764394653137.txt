I want you to build a complete desktop software using the following strict requirements:

🔹 Technology Requirements

Frontend UI: React (functional components, hooks, clean modular folder structure, reusable components, responsive layout, modern UI design similar to Material-UI or Chakra UI)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MySQL (strictly use MySQL only)

Desktop App Packaging: Electron (React + Node backend wrapped into one desktop executable)

Auto-create the MySQL database & tables on first launch with:

host: localhost

user: root

password: root (or 12345)

database name: prism

🔹 Software Purpose

The software will be a studio / room / film production booking & scheduling system, modeled on the logic used in the PRISM software shown in the reference video.

The logic includes:

Book a studio/room/department slot

Assign customer, project, editor, booking time, actual time, break hours

Prevent booking conflicts unless “Ignore Conflict Flag” enables it

Manage master data (rooms, editors, customers, projects)

Capture booking status (Tentative, Confirmed, Planning, Completed)

Modify bookings, repeat bookings, cancel bookings

Generate reports

Dashboard calendar for booking overview

Login screen with company selection

Modern, clean, attractive UI (not outdated like the old PRISM UI)

🔹 Core Modules to Build
1. Authentication Module

Fields:

Username

Security PIN

Company (dropdown)

Today’s date (auto-filled, non-editable)

Features:

Validate user from MySQL

If first run, auto-create user table with 1 default admin user

Store session

Redirect to main dashboard

2. Main Window

Top menu (same structure as PRISM):

Operations

Masters

Reports

Utility

Windows

Exit

The main area should show:

Calendar (month view) on left

Booking grid (table with bookings) on right

“Hide Canceled Booking” checkbox

Add / Modify / Exit buttons

3. Booking Schedule Module

Booking form fields:

Date

Booking From Time – To Time (hh:mm)

Actual From Time – To Time

Break (hh:mm)

Customer (dropdown from master)

Project (dropdown from master)

Room (dropdown)

Editor (dropdown)

Status (Tentative, Confirmed, Planning, Completed)

Remarks

Cancel booking + Reason

Automatic calculations:

Total Booking Time

Total Actual Time

Total Hours

Features:

Delete/Cancel Booking

Repeat Booking (like PRISM: From Date → To Date, repeated daily/weekly)

4. Master Modules

Editor Master
5. Reports Module

Generate reports in:

PDF

6. Database Requirements

On first run, auto-create database prism and the following tables:

users

rooms

customers

projects

editors

booking_repeat

audit_log

Include proper schema:

Primary keys

Foreign keys

Default timestamps

Soft delete flags

🔹 UI Requirements

Clean, modern, attractive design

Light theme with soft shadows, rounded cards, good spacing

Smooth modal windows for booking

Calendar component must be modern (React Calendar or FullCalendar)

Booking grid must be searchable and sortable

Desktop app should look like a professional enterprise tool

🔹 Deliverables

Please generate:

1. Full project folder structure

frontend/

backend/

electron/

2. Complete code for:

React UI

Node.js backend

MySQL scripts

Electron packaging

Auto database creation

3. Instructions for:

Running development environment

Building desktop executable for Windows

Seeding master data

4. Example demo data
🔹 Very Important

You must exactly replicate the PRISM workflow shown in the provided screenshots and video, but with a more modern and easier-to-use UI.
